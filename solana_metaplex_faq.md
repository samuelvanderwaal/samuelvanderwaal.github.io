## Solana

Q: What is the difference between `devnet` and `testnet`?

A: `devnet` is targeted at developers to let them test their smart contracts and applications before deploying to mainnet. `testnet` is used primarily to test new Solana releases. See the [Solana docs](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints) for more details.

Q: What free RPC endpoints are available? 

A: For devnet:

* https://api.devnet.solana.com

For mainnet:

 See the [Solana docs](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints) for more details such as rate limits.

 For production, you should consider using a custom RPC endpoint.
