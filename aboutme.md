### Software

I am a [software developer](https://github.com/samuelvanderwaal) with a particular interest in Rust.

### Blockchain

I have been following the blockchain space since 2010 and have invested in mulitple blockchain projects. I am currently exploring the [Solana ecosystem](https://solana.com/) and the [Metaplex NFT standard](https://docs.metaplex.com) in particular.

### Investing

I am interested in investments outside of blockchains. Contact me if you think we would make a good team.
